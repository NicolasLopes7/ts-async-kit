# ðŸš€ ts-async-kit
A lightweight TypeScript library that provides an easy-to-use API for dealing with common promise-related operations such as retrying and looping.

## Installation
To install ts-async-kit in your project, simply run:

```sh
pnpm i ts-async-kit
```

## Usage

### Retry
Sometimes, a promise may fail due to a temporary issue such as a network error. In such cases, retrying the operation can be a useful strategy. With ts-async-kit, you can easily retry a promise until it succeeds or reaches a maximum number of attempts.

Here's an example:

```ts
import { retry } from 'ts-async-kit';

const fetchData = async () => {
  // Fetch data from an API
};

const result = await retry(fetchData, { maxRetries: 3 })
```

In the above example, fetchData is called up to three times, and the result is logged to the console if successful. If all attempts fail, an error is thrown.

### Loop (WIP)
Sometimes, you may need to perform a task repeatedly, such as polling an API for updates. With `ts-async-kit`, you can control how your loop will work. Error-tolerant, concurrent operations, until a condition is met, maximum number of iterations and so on...

Here's an example:

```ts

import { map } from 'ts-async-kit';

const data = [1, 2, 3]
const pollApi = async (id: number) => {
  // Poll an API for updates
};

const result = await map(data, pollApi, { concurrency: 2 })
```
In the above example, pollApi is called up until it finishes executing two promises concurrently. If all iterations fail, an error is thrown.
